I am a Working Student at Siemens Gamesa. I have an extensive background working with SCADA Systems/Projects, Web Development, data analytics to make informed decisions.

I recently expanded my skill set to include topics like Quarto, Power BI, Power Apps(Model Driven Development), working in cross-language R/Python environment and data visualizations using animation and interactivity. I love learning new things constantly and sharing my knowledge with others in a digestible manner.
